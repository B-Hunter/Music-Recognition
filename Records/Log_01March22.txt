## Part 1, complete!

After a solid month of working on our code, we managed to create a program which:

a) Grabs two images, subtracts, and leaves staff lines
b) Create a rectangle around a part of the staff line, then iterate from left/right top/bottom
c) Grab coordinate values of every rectangle and store them into a .txt file

It took a lot of effort to finish this code. Most of the time was spent on fixing errors, while
the calculations were a little easier. Often we were one variable off, or coding in python 
incorrectly for what we wanted to do. 

I've enjoyed the process so far, and python's syntax is a breathe of fresh air compared
to other languages. It's been gratifiying finishing every step, and creating our own
algorithms to do what we wanted the program to do.   

Our next step is now working with machine learning! This next section was my motivation 
to start this project, and I hope it meets me with my current expectations.
